# Third Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

- My motivation when completing this project was to put into practice and become more proficient in the concepts I have learned in each module of Bootcamp - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web API.
- I built this project to apply what I have learned in class about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web API to a real web application. Creating my own coding quiz from scratch allowed me to advance my skills in the previously mentioned coding languages, and enlightened me to the areas of my capabilities that are in need of improvement.
- During the completion of this project, I learned how to properly use EventTarget Objects, Document Methods, Element Methods and more, to dynamically increase the functionality of my web application through JavaScript.
