# Third Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

- My motivation when completing this project was to put into practice and become more proficient in the concepts I have learned in Module 5: Third Party APIs of Bootcamp.
- I built this project to apply what I have learned in class about JavaScript, jQuery, Day.js, etcetera, to a real web application. Creating my own Work Day Scheduler from the starter-code provided allowed me to advance my skills in  JavaScript, jQuery, Day.js, etcetera, and enlightened me to the areas of my capabilities that are in need of improvement.
- During the completion of this project, I learned how to properly use Day.js to retrieve the current date and time, use jQuery to decrease the length and increase the efficiency of my JS code, and more. All of these skills helped me to dynamically increase the functionality of my web application through JavaScript.
